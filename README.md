- **Automated Claim Extraction**: Identify and isolate fact-checkable claims from transcribed text.
- **AI-Powered Fact-Checking**: Utilize the Groq API for rapid, intelligent fact verification.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: 
  - Timeline of claims and their verification status
  - Network graph of speakers and topics
  - Truth meter for sentiment analysis
- **Efficient Web Search**: Gather relevant information to support fact-checking with caching and rate limiting.
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Maintain debate context for more accurate fact-checking and topic tracking.
- **Summary Generation**: Produce concise summaries of debate key points and verification results.

## 🚀 Getting Started
